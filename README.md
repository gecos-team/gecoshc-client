# Installing
To install this project use the DEB package by:

``

# Configuring
After installing is important to configure the client by editing /etc/helpchannel.conf file.
The most important thing to configure is the Help Channel server URL (tunnel_url):
```
[TunnelConfig]
command_full_path: /usr/bin/hctunnel.py
tunnel_url: wss://helpchannel.yourdomain.com/wsServer
local_port=6000
ssl_verify=False
```

If your SSL certificates are valid (not self-signed certificates) you may set "ssl_verify=True".
